storyboard:
start with end of game, intro--text with sky background--

its been a journey to make it here
it was worth it

level 1 - walking
in the beginning i wondered through life, going L and R, following the path I could see
going up through each stage

level 2 - jumping
I struggled through obstacles,
putting some SPACE between them and I


level 3 - jumping contd

level 4 - double


but then i met you
you filled my world with colour

even though i was doing the same things as before, they were now filled with colour


2d colour -you filled my world with colour
3d low poly-you gave me a new perspective -- redofirst few levels bu

i was tired with the repetetiveness of life, doing the same thing over and overe again
i wished for it all to end
to stop all of this
but then i met you
you were my shining light in darkness that became my world
you ignited something inside me
something i havent felt in a long time

you felt different than the rest, you felt special, i was drawn to you
you changed my world you gave me light for my world
although you were special to me, i wasnt special to you
i was anothr passerby 
it nearly broke me,just as i was starting to feel alive again

you were so far away, a place i could never reach

but then you opened up your heart to me
i felt special, i felt like i could fly
i felt on top of the world
but i realised that i wasn't the only one in your heart
you, just like many others, had a past
however instead of past that has been severed, yours remains intact
I felt vulnerable, scared, after opening up to you, i see that im not that special
